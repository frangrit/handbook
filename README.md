# Handbook

**‚ö†Ô∏è WIP ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The Rumors handbook is an ongoing documentation of our process and operations. It is developed collaboratively, updated frequently, and maintained mostly by [@frangrit](https://github.com/frangrit). There are two sections, written with different audiences in mind:

- The [client welcome packet](clients/index.md) is an overview of our approach and what we expect during client engagements.
- The [employee handbook](employees/index.md) goes into great detail about what we do, how we do it, and our guiding philosophies, plus practical matters like operating hours and benefits.
