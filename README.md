# Handbook

**‚ö†Ô∏è WIP ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The Rumors handbook is an ongoing documentation of our process and operations. It is developed collaboratively, updated frequently, and maintained mostly by [@frangrit](https://github.com/frangrit). There are two sections, written with different audiences in mind:

- [Client welcome packet.](clients/index.md) An overview of our approach and what to expect during client engagements. 
- [Employee handbook.](employees/index.md) Lots of detail about what we do, how we do it, and our guiding philosophies, plus practical matters like operating hours and benefits.
