# Handbook

**‚ö†Ô∏è WIP ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The Rumors handbook is an ongoing documentation of our process and operations. It is developed collaboratively, updated frequently, and maintained mostly by [@frangrit](https://github.com/frangrit). There are two sections, written with different audiences in mind:

- **For clients.** An overview of our approach and what we expect during client engagements. [Read the client welcome packet ‚Üí](clients/index.md)
- **For new employees.** Lots of detail about what we do, how we do it, and our guiding philosophies, plus practical matters like operating hours and benefits. [Read the employee handbook ‚Üí](employees/index.md)
