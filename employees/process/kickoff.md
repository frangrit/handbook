# Kickoff

A kickoff meeting is the official project initiation and an opportunity to meet stakeholders, lay out project objectives, review the schedule, and possibly do a few design exercises or play a project-oriented game. Kickoff meetings are best in real life, human-to-human, not over the phone.

We schedule a kickoff meeting shortly after we receive the client’s signed proposal. Send an agenda a few days before the meeting — [here is a sample agenda](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/_Kickoff-meeting-agenda-template--ATm5OihYtbWEOTglXDpvXA0RAg-A5Bmqw5hNOeJoQe3aMGoF).

## Be prepared

Do your research beforehand. You should already have a clear sense of the project goals and risks, audience and user goals, and basic requirements. If possible, conduct a few stakeholder interviews beforehand — this is a great time to get more candid feedback about the project, especially folks’ opinionated takes on success and potential roadblocks.

## Who should be there

Who will make this meeting a success? All project stakeholders should have a place at the table. It’s better to include too many people at the beginning than to find out you’ve unintentionally left someone out. If the group size is upwards of ten people, hold a series of kickoffs of smaller groups with shared goals.

## Best practices

- Set aside at least two hours for the meeting. Timebox and take breaks.
- Reserve a room with a large table where folks can sit in a circle facing each other.
- Have a whiteboard and markers handy.
- Appoint a facilitator to lead the meeting and keep things on track, especially if you’ve got a lot of ground to cover. It’s useful to have two people from the Rumors team on hand, one to actively facilitate, the other to observe and take notes without distraction. Post meeting notes publicly afterward.
- Bring snacks to share. This is a long meeting.

## What happens

We already have a good sense of the scope of the project. Now it’s time to be sure we’re all in agreement, and to fill in some detail. There might be some overlap during the kickoff with the questions you discussed during the project discovery process and call. No need to repeat yourself; choose from these questions the ones that still need clarification. The first two parts of the meeting are quick formalities — the real fun comes with a goals discussion and all that follows.

### Introductions

Who’s present? What’s their role in the company and on the project? One or two sentences, max.

### Scope and process

Briefly review project dates, phases, and deliverables for the benefit of everyone in the room. Address what’s in scope and what’s out of scope. Confirm point-people on both sides of the table. Who will talk to whom and when? How will we keep in touch? How often can the client expect updates?

### Goals and priorities

Why are we embarking on this project? Why now? What does success look like in this company’s culture and on this project specifically? What one idea or action should a website user walk away with? Open up these questions to the whole group.

If project priorities need reigning in, get the client team involved in a [K-J exercise](https://articles.uie.com/kj_technique/) — a stickies-and-Sharpies approach to effectively prioritize subjective data and opinions.

### Roundtable
Sometimes we run a [design studio](http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/2010/04/design-studioprototyping-exercise/)at a kickoff. Sometimes we discuss specific product features and goals. Every idea is worth noting, for it communicates something — frame discussion in a way that lets folks think imaginatively.

### Concerns
Someone at the table may be frustrated, concerned, or wary. Hear them out. Sometimes just listening makes the problem go away. If a concern is persistent, consider employing [the Five Whys](https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-five-whys-for-startups).

### Audience

We’ve been hired by the client, but our job is to serve the audience. Who is the audience for this product? Which of these groups is the most important? How much do we know about them? What actions or outcomes are desired? Is it possible to arrange for audience interviews?

### Success and risks

What does success look like to everyone in the room? What’s the one thing we must get right? What would exceed the client’s wildest dreams? What might stand in the way? You’ll probably get more candid answers to these questions during a pre-meeting stakeholder interview, but if that hasn’t happened, bring it up here.

### Wrap up

Wrap up the major points in the meeting. Let everyone know what to expect next. Thank everyone for their time.

## Post-kickoff

Compile and post the meeting notes to Paper, or distribute via email to the client.
