# Retrospective

A project retrospective is a discussion to analyze what was successful and unsuccessful about a project. During a retro, we positively, constructively ‚Äî even optimistically ‚Äî examine project process and outcomes to learn what to do better next time. Some agencies call this meeting a post-mortem. This is creepy.

Project retrospectives give us a chance to mark the end of a project, engage with each other and the client, and improve our process.

There are two ways we do a retro: formally, and informally.

## Client retro

Retrospectives with the client are usually more formal. We ask questions like these, letting the conversation flow organically.

- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What have you learned?
- What still puzzles you?
- What's next for the project?
- How might we be involved?

Want to be more specific? Here are some more ideas:

- Are you proud of our finished deliverables? If yes, what made them great? If no, what was wrong or missing?
- Did we get the results we wanted and did it make impact?
- Which of our methods or processes worked particularly well?
- Which of our methods or processes were difficult or frustrating to use?
- How would you do things differently next time to avoid this frustration?
- What was painful but necessary?
- What else could we do better next time?
- What did you learn about working with this particular client? (Or with us as a studio?)
- What was the most gratifying or professionally satisfying part of the project?

## Internal retro

Use the same set of questions for an internal retro, or keep it simple. On a whiteboard, draw three smileys in a column:

üôÇ 

‚òπÔ∏è 

üòê 

What did we like about this project? What did we dislike? What were we sort of _meh_ about? Using sticky notes, write down words and phrases for each smiley, put them up on the board, and discuss.

# Ground rules

- **Retro everything.** Dedicate time to review the outcome of every project. There‚Äôs always something to learn.
- **Do it right away.** Schedule the retro within three weeks of the project‚Äôs end, while everyone‚Äôs memories are fresh. On large or lengthy projects, run mini-retrospectives after milestones or development cycles.
- **Set an agenda.** Create an agenda and share it in advance to increase the chances you‚Äôll get thoughtful responses. Set aside an hour or longer for more complex projects. Someone should lead, and someone should take notes.
- **Create take-aways.** A retro is a waste of time if we don‚Äôt come away from it with actionable tasks and understandings. Create and self-assign specific, meaningful tasks to bring with you into the next project or cycle.
