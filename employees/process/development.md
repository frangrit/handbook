### Estimating time

Each issue in a project should have a story points estimate value by the time in lands in a specific cycle’s backlog. This is the system we’re trying now. It could change.

| Time        | Story points |
| ----------: | ------------ |
| < 1 day     | 1      		 |
| 1 day       | 2      		 |
| 2 days      | 4      		 |
| 3 days      | 6      		 |
| 6 days      | 12      	 |
| 12 days     | 24      	 |
| 24 days     | 48      	 |
| + days  	  | 96      	 |


We aim for a two week sprint cycle to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 12-14 story points. Things start to break down when you get 12 or even 6 story points. These values are more like placeholders — a way to track the complexity of an issue before it gets smaller, more specific, or more known.
