# Code of conduct

## TL;DR
- Be kind.
- Respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered.
- If you are asked to stop harassing behaviors, do it immediately.
- If you can't resolve a problem, contact Andy.

## This policy covers

Everyone who works at Rumors — in the studio in-person and virtually, and in public places as a representative of the studio. If you work here, this policy applies to you.

## Our standards

We expect you to be respectful, kind, and transparent toward your coworkers and clients and to actively participate in critiques and meetings.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a respectful environment include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints, contexts, and experiences.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Encouraging teammates to listen as much as they speak.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Offering support and enthusiasm for great ideas.
- Sharing knowledge and skills.
- Acknowledging all project participants, not just the most recent or loudest contributor.

### Don’t harass

Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any reason. Rumors does not tolerate harassment in any form.

Examples of behavior that can be harassment:

- Negative, offensive, or unwelcome remarks based on race, religion, national origin, age, ability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or physical appearance.
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention, advances, or physical contact without affirmative consent or after a request to stop.
- Deliberate intimidation, or patronizing language or behavior, like unconstructive criticism, repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else, feigning surprise at someone’s lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic, and unsolicited explanations. 

If you are asked to stop a harassing behavior, stop immediately. No excuses.

### Impact matters more than intent

It’s your responsibility to ensure that your behavior doesn’t have a negative impact on other people — conduct need not be intentional to be harassment. If you’re not sure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn’t.

## Enforcement

If you are being harassed by a coworker, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, speak with Andy right away.

If you engage in unacceptable behavior, Rumors may take any appropriate action including releasing you from employment.
