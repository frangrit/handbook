### Pause clause

We include a “Pause Clause” in all MSAs and enact it when needed. It’s an idea borrowed from [Bureau of Digital](https://bureauofdigital.com/blog/2017/5/30/the-pause-clause).

> If a client deliverable — such as input, approvals, or payment — is late more than 10 business days the project will be considered “on hold.” Once the deliverable is received and the project is re-activated it will be rescheduled based on our current workload and availability. To be clear: it could be weeks to get a project back in the pipeline if it is put on hold.

This clause sets expectations and keeps us on schedule internally. The language helps clients understand that even things outside their control could cause deliverables to be late (legal reviews, content from another source) and should be planned for accordingly.

We can waive the clause at our own discretion.
