# New employee onboarding

We’re a small studio, so new employee onboarding can be relatively casual. This checklist helps us keep track of what to do when we hire someone new.

### Welcome email

We’d like to start sending a welcome email to new employees. It might look something like this.

> Hi, welcome to Rumors. Here are some details to get you started.
> 
> - **Key.** Your key is on your desk. Use the keycard for after-hours access at the front door. Lock up when you leave.
> - **Heat, air conditioning, windows.** The remote is on the wall near the unit. Turn it off and close the windows when you leave.
> - **Trash and recycling.** We take turns taking out the trash and recycling, which is kept in the garage, accessible under the main stairwell in the lobby. Take out the trash on Friday when you leave.
> - **Bike room.** There’s a bike room on the ground floor. The code is on the whiteboard.
> - **Bathroom.** Bathroom code for our floor is on the whiteboard.
> - **Music.** Everyone is welcome to listen to music over the studio speaker. We all reserve the right to politely ask you to turn down the music, or turn it off altogether.
> - **Coffee, food, water.** We take turns bringing coffee beans. Make a pot if you’re the first to arrive. Any snacks on the shelves and La Croix in the refrigerator is for everyone. Otherwise, ask. If the water cooler is empty, refill it. Wash your dishes.
> - **Plants.** We take turns watering the plants, though Gina does much of the heavy lifting. You can manage plant watering using our open source [plants app](https://rumors-plants.netlify.com).
