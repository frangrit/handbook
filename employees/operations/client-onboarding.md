# Client onboarding

A smooth onboarding process helps clients feel good about working with us.

## Evaluating potential clients

How do we evaluate whether we want to work with a client? It’s a gut reaction supported by years of asking the same kinds of questions and following the same protocols with a new client or project.

Whether or not we want to work with a client, we reply to inquiries within two working days. Andy leads all new business development correspondence.

## Our values

The studio’s values are a good place to start. We value:

- Asking questions
- Solving problems
- Client collaboration
- Intuition and improvisation

Does the client’s mission align with our values?

## The project

Other questions address the project itself:

- Do we want to help the client achieve their goals? Do we believe that the client can accomplish what they’re trying to do? Do we want to try to introduce a new way of thinking about it?
- Is the client asking us to do something we’re good at? We like to know the _why_ of a project, and create  solutions based on research, strategy, and intuition.
- What’s the budget? Did the client disclose one at all?

## Typical red flags

- **Budget alignment.** When we know a budget before we start, we can help clients narrow their focus and make best use of our time and skills. We don’t work under budgets that can’t support our process and the time it takes to deliver our work. Clients who won’t disclose a budget are a strong red flag. 
- **Sophistication alignment.** Part of our job is to educate. A client who values our expertise is receptive to this kind of relationship while an unsophisticated client may be unwilling or even belligerent. That’s the kind of engagement we want to avoid.
- **Communication alignment.** Often we follow up an initial contact with a series of questions. Has the client responded promptly and forthrightly, or have we had to nag? Long periods of silence or useless answers to questions are often a bad sign of future project progress. There’s no reason to assume client behavior will change with a signed contract.

## Working directories

- Proposals in development go in Dropbox, in _Admin > Proposals and contracts > [Client name]_. We use a Pages template.
- Any assets go in _Team Folder > New Biz Dev > [Client name]_.
- Notes and drafts go in Dropbox Paper in _New Biz Dev_.

Don’t create a folder for inquiries we decline. Archive Dropbox directories for projects we haven’t gotten.

## Discovery call

A discovery call is our chance to learn more about the project and the client’s team, and to educate our clients on our process and approach. The discovery call fosters goodwill between the client and the studio, and demonstrates our value. It shouldn’t go longer than an hour. Some things we like to ask:

- Briefly describe your organization. Who are you, what do you do, and why is it important?
- Briefly describe the project. How do you imagine we’ll help?
- When would you like to get started? Does the project have a specific launch date?
- What role will you play during the project process?
- Do you have a budget in mind? 
- How did you find out about us?

## Client’s responsibility

What we expect from the client and their team when we embark on a project together.

- **Leadership.** We will shape a vision for a product, process, or brand — now and as it evolves over time. The client must carry forward that vision. Clients set the goals and make the final decisions, and they must be forthright in both.
- **Advocacy.** Someone on the client’s team will act as advocate and evangelist for the project. The advocate’s job is to keep the client’s team rallying around the project goals and to defend the project’s integrity.
- **Responsiveness.** We expect quick responses from our clients, too — usually within a day or two of delivery. We include an expected turn-around time when we send something.
- **Access.** To keep a project moving forward, we need access to key project stakeholders — the folks who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project.
- **Project management.** Someone on the client side will act as dedicated point person to manage schedules and deliverables, facilitate communication, and intervene when compromises are hard to reach.
