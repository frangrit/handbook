# About us

**Is it specific? Does it benefit the user? Does it translate ideas into form?**

Interactive products should be built with specific awareness of context and audience to address the right needs. Interfaces should benefit the user, providing user-centric experiences that delight and inform. Finally, the work should translate ideas into form, making use of design‚Äôs capacity to [convey meaning through style and behavior](https://vimeo.com/182326074).

How do we ensure our work meets this criteria?

- **We prioritize research.** We talk to stakeholders, interview users, audit the existing site, consider the market, and conduct additional exercises and workshops in an attempt to understand the needs, opportunities, and potential hazards of the project.
- **We develop strategic solutions.** This requires understanding the resources, both technological and human, that support the product moving forward. It‚Äôs better to create a streamlined set of tools that provide flexible outcomes than an enormous toolkit of options that ignore the reality of staff or financial limitations.
- **We marry forward-thinking design to user-centric experiences.** Our goal is to create innovative interfaces that are compelling and rewarding. We avoid routine solutions, and instead value new ideas that address a client‚Äôs unique message and needs. We refuse to chase after the novel if it results in unnecessary frustration.
- **We develop close relationships with our clients.** We dislike the idea that ‚Äúthe best clients get out of the way,‚Äù so we value close contact, frequent check-ins, collaboration, and engagement. Good work requires a good working relationship, and direct access to stakeholders and decision makers. Our clients like working with us.
