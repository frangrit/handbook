# Travel

You might need to travel for work once or twice a year. We’ll give you at least two weeks advance notice if we need you to be somewhere else. Rumors pays for all travel and lodging expenses, including up to $65 per diem for meals and incidentals. Save your receipts, submit them to Andy when you return, and he will reimburse you.
