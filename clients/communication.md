# Communication

We like to keep in touch — frequent, open communication is the best way to keep a project on track and spot potential roadblocks before they become insurmountable. 


## Meetings

Meetings should be under an hour and should have a purpose and an agenda, even a simple one. Most of our projects have these standing meetings:

- Project kickoff
- Weekly check-in or stand-up
- Bi-weekly cycle planning meeting
- Bi-weekly cycle demo and review
- Project retrospective

## Tools

We use a variety of tools to communicate with clients and with each other, and we’re comfortable adding to this list the tools that your team uses, too.

- **Phone.** Best for clearing up questions. One phone call is almost always more expedient than a series of emails.
- **Google Calendar and Hangouts.** We Google Calendar to keep track of meetings. We’ll send you an invitation that includes a Hangout link for videoconference meetings.
- **Email.** For quick questions, setting up meetings, exchanging documents, getting feedback. On large, long-term projects, we send a weekly wrap-up letting you know what we’ve worked on and what’s up next.
- **Dropbox Paper.** An excellent document-creation tool where we keep notes, project plans and roadmaps, briefs, and other text and writing.
- **Slack.** For in-office communication, especially if the team is distributed. If your team uses Slack, we can create a shared channel for your project.
- **GitHub.** Manages tasks and code for each project.

## Turn-around times

We respond during within two working days to most client requests, often sooner. If your request or issue is complex, we’ll let you know how long it should take, and we’ll be in touch again when it’s fixed. If we’re running behind, we’ll tell you.

We expect quick responses from you, too. We’ll include an expected turn-around time when we send you something — usually it is within two business days.

## Access

In order to get the sign-offs we need to keep a project moving forward, it’s important that we’re granted access to key project stakeholders — the folks who have a vested interest in the outcome of the project. If someone has a role to play in the project, or a valuable opinion on its outcome, it’s important that you put us in touch.

## Change management

Inevitably new ideas come up during a project’s progress, and you need to ask us to make changes. How we accommodate those requests is a process called change management. There are four ways to deal with changes:

- **Swap priorites and rebalance the backlog.** If the change is high-priority, this is a likely outcome. We’ll work with you to swap out some other activity or task so that we can accommodate this one instead, using project goals and anticipated outcomes as a yardstick.
- **Fold it in.** If the change is small enough and dependent on or closely related to something else we’re already doing, we may just do it. There’s usually a little bit of margin for this sort of thing.
- **Bill hourly.** If we have the time, we may bill extra for the new work. Usually this happens when your request clearly falls outside of the original scope of work.
- **Create a new project phase.** Another option is to roll this request, and any others, into a new phase of the project, for which we’ll write a whole new statement of work.

Good questions to ask yourself before requesting a change are: Does the requested change help to meet the original project goals? Is it part of the original project as defined in the statement of work? If you’re not sure, ask. If your request falls outside of the scope of the project, we’ll let you know why, and how best to address it.
