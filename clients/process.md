# Process

We strive to be honest, communicative, and easy to work with. We value collaboration, and work in dialog with clients as equal participants, and our whole team is involved in a project from the start -- strategy, design, and development. Our methodology is context-specific — a publication redesign requires a different approach than a digital strategy. Every client and project is different, but much of the time our process will look something like this. 

- Discover what we can about a potential project, but avoid writing a detailed statment of work. At this point, too much is unknown. We don’t want clients to be tied to our very early understanding of a project, as we inevitably uncover new and interesting ideas. This flexibility allows us to field requests and accommodate changes as the project progresses.
- Engage with clients in a kickoff meeting, strategy and planning sessions, stakeholder interviews, and user research, ideally on-site, to determine project priorities and outcomes
- Deliver a strategic brief outlining our findings and recommendations, and a roadmap for project completion. The roadmap covers the overall trajectory of goals, initiatives, and possible releases for a digital product. Some projects end there, others go on with further strategy, design, and development work.
- Plan our work in sets of two-week cycles, or sprints, which have stated goals, desired outcomes, and balanced sets of work based on client and user priorities. We work with clients to determine our outlook two sprints at a time; after that, things start to get fuzzy. At the end of a two-week sprint, we’ll show you our work. We’ll continue in this way until the work is done or the client says stop.
- Conduct a project retropective when we wrap things up, so that we can learn what we did well and where we can improve.
