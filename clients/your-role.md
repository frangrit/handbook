# Your role

As project stakeholders, you and your internal team have roles and obligations.

- **Leader.** We will help shape a vision and strategy for your product now and as it evolves over time. It’s up to you to carry forward that vision. You set the goals, and you make the final decisions, and we need you to be forthright in both.
- **Project manager and referee.** Someone on your team will act as dedicated project manager to oversee schedules, facilitate connections, ensure timely review of deliverables, provide status updates to your organization, and intervene when compromises are hard to reach. She’ll also allow us timely access to project staff and provide critical knowledge of operations and business practices, as needed.
- **Advocate and evangelist.** Someone on your team will act as advocate and evangelist for the project. The advocate’s job is to keep the team rallying around project goals and focus, to defend project integrity, and passionately promote the project within your organization.
- **Content governor.** You oversee project content — words, images, captions, microcopy, and metadata. You plan for and gather the content, sometimes writing it yourself, and deliver it to us as we needed. We’ll have strategies and resources for organizing, implementing, and improving it.
