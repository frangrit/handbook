# Who we are

Rumors is a small studio with four full-time designers. We work collaboratively, so while our roles are specific, they are also fluid. You will interact with the whole team during the course of a project.

- **Andy Pressman**, principal, andy@rumo.rs. You’ll talk to Andy about every aspect of the project, and especially about strategy and visual design — he’ll lead design presentations and most other meetings.
- **Frances Duncan**, strategist and producer, frances@rumo.rs. Frances shapes project strategy and product roadmaps, setting milestones and managing priorities. She’ll be your primary point of contact for day-to-day project operations. 
- **Gina Giampaolo**, designer and developer
- **Caleb Misclevitz**, designer and developer

Sometimes we partner with specialists to help us better address your project’s specific needs. We’ll let you know if we’ve brought someone new to the team.
