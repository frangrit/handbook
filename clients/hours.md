# Hours

At Rumors, we:

- Work 9-5 hours on Pacific time.
- Offer employees the opportunity to work remotely if needed.
- Opt out of calls and meetings most Wednesdays, so that we can have a full midweek day for heads-down work.
- Set aside at least half a day every Friday for internal projects.
- Never work weekends.
- Observe federal holidays and close for weeklong breaks twice yearly.

All this is to say that when we’re off-duty we’re really off-duty — so typically you won’t get email responses over the weekend and there won’t be anyone around to answer the phone at 8pm on a Tuesday. We’ll let you know if a major player on your project will be on vacation or otherwise out of the office. Regular time off means better work for our clients.
