# Hours

- We keep 9-5 hours on Pacific time.
- We don’t work weekends.
- We observe federal holidays — if the US Post Office is closed, so are we.

We close for the **week between Christmas and New Year’s Day** and the **week of July 4**. We determine the exact closure dates the preceding quarter, and we’ll let you know in advance if the closure affects your project.

All this is to say that when we’re off-duty we’re really off-duty — so typically you won’t get email responses over the weekend and there won’t be anyone around to answer the phone at 8 PM on a Tuesday. We’ll let you know if a major player on your project will be on vacation or otherwise out of the office. Regular time off means better work for our clients.
